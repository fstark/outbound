# Floppy disk dumps

This machine came with 4 Outbound branded disks:
* Software for the Outbound Laptop System - Version 1.1 (3 copies of the same disk)
* Your Guided Tour of the Outbound Laptop System - Version 1.0

The disks were dumped with a Greaseweazle, a Chinon F-357L floppy drive and the following command:
`gw read --format mac.800 --tracks c=0-79 image.dsk`

Two of the software disks were identical, the remaining one was unreadable but every good sector was identical to the other good dumps.

The guided tour contains the following tour:
